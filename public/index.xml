      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;andori-log-i-a-unnamed&#34;&gt;ANDORI-LOG I-A &amp;ldquo;unnamed&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt; It used to be so simple, no? Every day, repeating like a program being run over and over again. Sometimes I wish we could return to those times. Even the smallest moment of peace would help me see what beauty is left in this world. &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;The guys up there want us off of this planet as soon as possible, but they do not even have the slightest idea of what we are dealing with over here. This shit is contagious, it spreads like wildfire, consuming everything in its path given enough time. Land swept by it has either sprouted more of its kind, or been left a barren mess. We have been working our ass off trying to contain it in a small area, and now they want us to abandon all of our progress to go back and help them fend it off [REDACTED]. &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt; I really do not know what would happen if we left the whole fucking planet for that thing to slowly consume like the gluttonous beast it is. I feel it already knows us and when it gets strong enough, it will come back and bite us in the ass. &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Of course they do not care though, why would they? Why would they go through the databases and databases of research materials and results when they can make the decision right then and there? This whole thing is a damn joke. I have had enough of this. &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
