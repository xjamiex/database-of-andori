<p>I really do not know what would happen if we left the whole fucking planet for that thing to slowly consume like the gluttonous beast it is. I feel it already knows us and when it gets strong enough, it will come back and bite us in the ass.</p>
<p>Of course they do not care though, why would they? Why would they go through the databases and databases of research materials and results when they can make the decision right then and there? This whole thing is a damn joke. I have had enough of this.</p>
