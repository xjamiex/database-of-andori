# Hello in a new age

You can call me Mirus and I forked the original Terminal theme for Hugo, because Radek, the original creator of the theme stop the maintenance and archived the repo. 

So I already pushed a few improvements that I did for my humble blog and I'm going to add some more features in the future, also any contribution is welcome 

Below you can read the original about from Radek

# Hi there

My name is Radek and I'm the author of this theme.
I made it to help you present your ideas easier.

We all know how hard is to start something on the web,
especially these days. You need to prepare a bunch of stuff,
configure them and when that’s done — create the content.

This theme is pretty basic and covers all of the essentials.
All you have to do is start typing!

The theme includes:

- **5 duotone themes**,
depending on your preferences (orange, red, blue, green, pink)
- [**Fira Code**](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)
as default monospaced font. It's gorgeous!
- **really nice, custom duotone** syntax highlighting based on
[**PrismJS**](https://prismjs.com)
- mobile friendly layout

So, there you have it... enjoy!
