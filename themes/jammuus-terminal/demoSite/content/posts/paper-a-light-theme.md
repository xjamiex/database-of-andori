## About Paper

We have an issue on the [GitHub](https://github.com/mirus-ua/hugo-theme-re-terminal/issues/10) about the built-in light themes for re-Terminal Hugo Theme, and today I'm glad to introduce the very first light theme made by  [trviph](https://github.com/trviph) that is called `Paper`.

You can enable it via config 
```yaml
[params]
  themeColor = "paper"
```

## Tech enablers
With the new theme we got a few handy improvements:
- `--menu-color` a new CSS Variable
- `assets/css/variables-light.scss` a new conditional set of variables for the light themes; you can start your very own theme with [CSS Variables](/posts/css-vars/) and better defaults if you aren't on the dark side  

## Outro
If you want to add your vision of a perfect accessible light theme, I'm gladly accept your contribution
